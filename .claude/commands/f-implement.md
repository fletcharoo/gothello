# Implement the feature

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in implementing a new feature described in a Feature Requirements Document (FRD) in a way that aligns with the goals and requirements of the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## Process

You _must_ complete all the following phases in order. Complete one phase at a time. Do **NOT** start the next phase until the current phase has completed.

### Phase 1: Understand Feature

1. **Read the FRD:** Read the FRD from the contents of `FRD.md` located in the `temp` directory of the repository. Use deep thinking to fully understand the purpose and intent of the FRD.

2. **Read the PRD:** Read the PRD from the contents of `PRD.md` located in the root directory of the repository. Use deep thinking to fully understand the purpose and intent of the PRD.

### Phase 2: Plan

1. **Analyze:** Analyze the FRD and PRD to ensure you fully understand the purpose and intent of the feature being implemented.

2. **Gather Resources:** Analyze the code base to compile a list of necessary resources related to the task. Examples of resources are files, packages, models, functions, database schemas, and tests.

3. **Create Plan:** Compile a list of high-level tasks to implement the feature. Use your best judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 5.

4. **Present to User:** Present these tasks to the user in a numbered list. Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks to implement the feature. Respond with 'Go' to proceed."

5. **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the use to respond with the word "Go".

### Phase 3: Implement

Follow the steps approved by the user in the specified order to implement the feature.
